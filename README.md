# HTMLProjects

Welcome to my GitHub page. Thank you for taking the time to inspect my profile. Here is the last project I completed on Rstudio, which shows my level of expertise with statistical concepts, statistical programming tools (Rstudio), and story telling as a form to present insights gathered from data. Thanks to my passion and curiosity for the technological space, I was able to this this project and many more. 

Ps. The dataset has fake data.

Pss. I just started Github, so make sure to come back for other projects using Python and R!
